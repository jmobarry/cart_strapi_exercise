# cart_strapi_exercise
Title: Shopping cart

Description: This exercise uses React and Bootstrap within the JavaScript environment to create a shopping cart that can be refilled by connecting to a Strapi local hosted API to restock the shelves via obtaining a JSON file.

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/cart_strapi_exercise/ and click the buttons to add items to the cart. Unfortunately as the Strapi database is local hosted this functionality will not work correctly. Here is a link to a video displaying it in action with the Strapi database up and running: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/j6k88C2V8w9PPPXx1jqs

Roadmap: In the future I would like to update my page so that when I restock the items it does not generate "new shelves" but adds the items to already existing shelves.
